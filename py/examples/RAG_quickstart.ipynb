Use margining capabilities as described in [c8c6243] and [5a38de4]. The Margining Lane Control and Status Registers include Receiver Number fields that can help identify specific receivers experiencing errors.\\n\\n3.

Monitor the Margining Lane Status Register as mentioned in [d50422d], which reflects error status information when a Control SKP Ordered Set is received and passes CRC and parity checks.\\n\\n5.
