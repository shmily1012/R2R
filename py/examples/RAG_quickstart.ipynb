       "R2RResults[RAGResponse](results=RAGResponse(generated_answer='To find a receiver error in the context of PCI Express®, specific mechanisms and registers are involved, particularly related to error checking and status reporting. Here\\'s how to identify receiver errors based on the provided context:\\n\\n1. **Check for Correctable Errors and Receiver Error Implementation**:\\n   - Some level of checking for Receiver Errors is required in all cases, even if certain bits are optional. Specifically, if the implementation does not support a particular bit (for historical reasons), bit 0 of the Correctable Error Mask Register must also not be implemented [e06963b].\\n\\n2. **Use Margining Registers for Per-Lane Error Detection**:\\n   - The **Margining Lane Status Register** provides per-lane status information, including the \"Receiver Number Status\" field (bits 2:0), which can indicate the status of the receiver [c8c6243]. This register helps monitor lane-specific receiver behavior during margining operations.\\n   - The corresponding **Margining Lane Control Register** includes a \"Receiver Number\" field (bits 2:0) that selects the receiver for margining control [5a38de4].\\n\\n3. **Analyze Error Injection Settings**:\\n   - The **Flit Error Injection Control 1 Register** includes a bit called \"Inject Errors on Received Flits\", which, when set, enables error injection on received flits. This can be used to test error detection mechanisms [7d24bc2].\\n\\n4. **Validate Control SKP Ordered Sets**:\\n   - When a Control SKP Ordered Set is received, the Downstream Port must reflect the **Margining Lane Status Register** if the Margin CRC and Margin Parity checks pass. This includes evaluating the Receiver Number in the Margining Lane Control Register (e.g., values 010b to 101b) [d50422d].\\n\\nIn summary, receiver errors can be detected through status registers like the Margining Lane Status Register [c8c6243], control registers for error injection [7d24bc2], and by validating received ordered sets using CRC and parity checks [d50422d], with general requirements for error checking always in place [e06963b].', search_results=AggregateSearchResult(chunk_search_results=[ChunkSearchResult(score=0.673, text=For historical reasons, implementation of this bit is optional.

Here\\'s how to identify receiver errors based on the provided context:\\n\\n1. **Check for Correctable Errors and Receiver Error Implementation**:\\n   - Some level of checking for Receiver Errors is required in all cases, even if certain bits are optional. Specifically, if the implementation does not support a particular bit (for historical reasons), bit 0 of the Correctable Error Mask Register must also not be implemented [e06963b].\\n\\n2. **Use Margining Registers for Per-Lane Error Detection**:\\n   - The **Margining Lane Status Register** provides per-lane status information, including the \"Receiver Number Status\" field (bits 2:0), which can indicate the status of the receiver [c8c6243]. This register helps monitor lane-specific receiver behavior during margining operations.\\n   - The corresponding **Margining Lane Control Register** includes a \"Receiver Number\" field (bits 2:0) that selects the receiver for margining control [5a38de4].\\n\\n3. **Analyze Error Injection Settings**:\\n   - The **Flit Error Injection Control 1 Register** includes a bit called \"Inject Errors on Received Flits\", which, when set, enables error injection on received flits. This can be used to test error detection mechanisms [7d24bc2].\\n\\n4. **Validate Control SKP Ordered Sets**:\\n   - When a Control SKP Ordered Set is received, the Downstream Port must reflect the **Margining Lane Status Register** if the Margin CRC and Margin Parity checks pass. This includes evaluating the Receiver Number in the Margining Lane Control Register (e.g., values 010b to 101b) [d50422d].\\n\\nIn summary, receiver errors can be detected through status registers like the Margining Lane Status Register [c8c6243], control registers for error injection [7d24bc2], and by validating received ordered sets using CRC and parity checks [d50422d], with general requirements for error checking always in place [e06963b].'))"
